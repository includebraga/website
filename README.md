# Website

This repository here contains all the code for our website. It uses Gatsby, a static site generator based on React. The website shall be deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), a tool that works like Heroku, but only for front-end apps.

You can check this link [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-with-components/) to learn how to build pages with Gatsby.

## Contributing

Due to issues with Netlify, it's better to use `npm` instead of `yarn`. So, to contribute to this repository simply clone it and run `npm install`.

For development purposes you should run `npm run development`, and then visit the website at `localhost:8000`. This command auto compiles the source code with hot reloading enabled.
